# How to contribute to the GoVote project

We are glad you are here. We need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition. All contributions are subject to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Here are some important resources:

*
*

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/codeforgso/GoVote/issues/new).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/codeforgso/GoVote/issues/new).  
Follow the [Issue template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) and be sure to include as much information as possible in the bug section of the issue template. Required information for reported bugs include: **Expected Behavior**, **Current Behavior**, **Possible Solution**, and **Steps to Reproduce**.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Fill out the information requested in the [Pull Request Template](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to the best extent possible.

#### **Do you want to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest and [discuss your change in a new issue](https://github.com/codeforgso/GoVote/issues/new) using the the **feature discussion** section of the issue template. Gennerally, it is a good idea to discuss a path forward relating to a proposed, or existing feature change prior to submitting a pull request to avoid a rejected contribution.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about the project or contributing by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/codeforgso/GoVote/issues/new) and labeling it as a question.

#### Coding conventions
